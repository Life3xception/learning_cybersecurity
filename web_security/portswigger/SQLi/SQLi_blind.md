# Blind SQL injection

<!-- LINK PORTSWIGGER: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind - TODO -->

## Definition

Blind SQL injection arises when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses do not contain the results of the relevant SQL query or the details of any database errors.

With blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, many techniques such as [UNION attacks](SQLi_union_attacks.md), are not effective because they rely on being able to see the results of the injected query within the application's responses. It is still possible to exploit blind SQL injection to access unauthorized data, but different techniques must be used.

## Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses

Consider an application that uses tracking cookies to gather analytics about usage. Requests to the application include a cookie header like this:

	Cookie: TrackingId=u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4

When a request containing a `TrackingId` cookie is processed, the application determines whether this is a known user using an SQL query like this:

```
SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'
```

This query is vulnerable to SQL injection, but the results from the query are not returned to the user. However, the application does behave differently depending on whether the query returns any data. If it returns data (because a recognized `TrackingId` was submitted), then a "Welcome back" message is displayed within the page.

This behavior is enough to be able to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability and retrieve information by triggering different responses conditionally, depending on an injected condition. To see how this works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following `TrackingId` cookie values in turn: 

	…xyz' AND '1'='1
	…xyz' AND '1'='2

The query becomes, in the two cases:

```
SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'abc…xyz' AND '1'='1'

SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'abc…xyz' AND '1'='2'
```

The first one will return results, because the injected `AND '1'='1` condition is true, and so the "Welcome back" message will be displayed. Whereas the second value will cause the query to not return any results, because the injected condition is false, and so the "Welcome back" message will not be displayed. This allows us to determine the answer to any single injected condition, and so extract data one bit at a time.

For example, suppose there is a table called `Users` with the columns `Username` and `Password`, and a user called `Administrator`. We can systematically determine the password for this user by sending a series of inputs to test the password one character at a time.

To do this, we start with the following input:

```
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm
```

This returns the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is true, and so the first character of the password is greater than `m`.

Next, we send the following input:

```
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 't
```

This does not return the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is false, and so the first character of the password is not greater than `t`.

Eventually, we send the following input, which returns the "Welcome back" message, thereby confirming that the first character of the password is `s`:

```
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's
```

We can continue this process to systematically determine the full password for the `Administrator` user.

**Note:** The `SUBSTRING` function is called `SUBSTR` on some types of database. For more details, see the [SQL injection cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet).

See [SQLi_blind_triggering_conditional_responses_exploit.py](SQLi_blind_triggering_conditional_responses_exploit.py) for an example of script that performs a blind SQL injection.

## Inducing conditional responses by triggering SQL errors

In the preceding example, suppose instead that the application carries out the same SQL query, but does not behave any differently depending on whether the query returns any data. The preceding technique will not work, because injecting different Boolean conditions makes no difference to the application's responses.

In this situation, it is often possible to induce the application to return conditional responses by triggering SQL errors conditionally, depending on an injected condition. This involves modifying the query so that it will cause a database error if the condition is true, but not if the condition is false. Very often, an unhandled error thrown by the database will cause some difference in the application's response (such as an error message), allowing us to infer the truth of the injected condition.

To see how this works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following `TrackingId` cookie values in turn:

	xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a
	xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a

These inputs use the `CASE` keyword to test a condition and return a different expression depending on whether the expression is true. With the first input, the `CASE` expression evaluates to 'a', which does not cause any error. With the second input, it evaluates to 1/0, which causes a divide-by-zero error. Assuming the error causes some difference in the application's HTTP response, we can use this difference to infer whether the injected condition is true.

Using this technique, we can retrieve data in the way already described, by systematically testing one character at a time:

	xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a

See [SQLi_blind_triggering_conditional_responses_through_errors_exploit.py](SQLi_blind_triggering_conditional_responses_through_errors_exploit.py) for an example of script that performs a blind SQL injection inducing conditional responses by triggering SQL errors.

**Useful tips**:

- Checking if the table users exists (in Oracle DB):
	
	`TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM users WHERE ROWNUM = 1)||'`

	As this query does not return an error, you can infer that this table does exist. Note that the `WHERE ROWNUM = 1` condition is important here to prevent the query from returning more than one row, which would break our concatenation. 


- Test whether specific entries exist in a table. For example, use the following query to check whether the username administrator exists:
	
	`TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'`
	
	Verify that the condition is true (the error is received), confirming that there is a user called administrator.

- Determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this, change the value to:

	`TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>1 THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'`

	This condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length. We can iterate this query increasing the length of the password and we will find the lenght of the administrator's password when we will no longer get an error from the server.
